# Wavy Circular Progress Guidelines

1. Basic Geometric Shapes  
Circle: The core of the animation is a circle, which can be generated using the polar coordinate formula \((x, y) = (r \cdot \cos(\theta), r \cdot \sin(\theta))\).  
Arc Length Control: By limiting the arc length (i.e., the angular range), the visible portion of the circle can be dynamically adjusted. For example, an arc length of \(\pi\) displays a semicircle, while \(2\pi\) displays a full circle.

2. Wave Effect  
Sine Wave Superposition: The wave effect is generated by superimposing sine waves on the circle. Specifically:  
For each angle \(\theta\), calculate an offset \(\Delta r = A \cdot \sin(k \cdot \theta + \omega t)\), where:  
- \(A\) is the amplitude, controlling the height of the wave.  
- \(k\) is the wavenumber, controlling the density of the wave.  
- \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, controlling the speed of the wave.  
- \(t\) is the time variable for animation.  
The final radius \(r' = r + \Delta r\) generates the wave shape.
The wave amplitude is `thickness / 4`, the wave wavenumber is `4 + radius / 4`, the wave angular frequency is `0.005`.

3. Dynamic Updates and Animation  
Time Variable: By introducing the time variable \(t\), the shape of the wave can be dynamically updated to create an animation effect.  
Interpolation Smoothing: Use interpolation algorithms (e.g., Catmull-Rom curves) to smooth the wave path and avoid jagged edges.

4. Combining Track and Wave Arcs  
Track Arc: When the dynamic wave does not cover the entire circle, a track arc is needed to fill the gaps. The path of the track arc can be generated using the polar coordinate formula, but its angular range complements that of the wave arc.  
Dynamic Switching: Adjust the display range of the track and wave arcs dynamically based on changes in arc length. The `linecap` is set to `round`.
The Track Arc's start and end angle has a gap with the wave arc, gap degree value is `0.01 * \pi`.

# Circular Progress with Wavy - Development Guidelines

## Props

- `value`: number, the value of the progress, range is 0-100.
- `size`: number, the size of the progress, default is 40dp.
- `thickness`: number, the thickness of the progress, default is 4dp.

## Implementation

- Use svg to draw the progress, and use classname to control the style.
- Make sure the animation state is not affected by the props change.
- The wavy circle's radius should less than the radius of the track circle, decrease half of the thickness.
